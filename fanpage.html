    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Justin Timberlake is an American singer-songwriter, musician and actor who gained worldwide popularity in the
        late 1990s as a member of NSYNC, one of the best-selling boy bands in history. He later became one of the most
        prominent and commercially successful pop stars of the new millennium after releasing his solo albums during the
        group’s hiatus. After attaining this pop peak, Timberlake followed up on other ventures, including film acting
        and entrepreneurship.

        director in Shelby Forest. Timberlake started singing at a young age. He cites Janet Jackson as his major
        musical influence.
